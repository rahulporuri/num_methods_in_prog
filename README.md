solutions to exercises as part of the numerical methods in programming course at IIT Madras.
to the most extent, solutions are written in c, python and fortran. briefly speaking,

* additional exercises contain various example codes, one of which is used to estimate the value of pi using monte carlo integration and using the simpson's and trapezoid rules.

* exercise0 contains codes to estimate the precision of a system, to convert a number to it's binary equivalent and the various ways in which one can give inputs to a code in all three languages to estimate the area of a circle and how to store output of a code in a file.
* exercise1 contains codes showing how one give input to a code using file pointers, how to plot data using gnuplot & fitting data using gnuplot and estimating the sum of 1/N
* exercise2 contains codes showing how to estimate the first and second derivative of a function, how to do function definitions and function calls in C and how to error of the estimate is different for the various methods used to estimate the derivative - forward, backward and center methods. we also show the use of make files to compile codes.
* exercise3 contains codes showing how to estimate the integration of a function between two points using various methods - trapezoid, simpson and three-eights rule. errors were also estimated using various methods.
* exercise4 contains codes showing hwo to estimate the integration of a function between two points using the adaptive integration method and we then compare the error in the estimates, using adaptive and using trapezoid methods.
* exercise5 contains
* exercise7 contains code showing how to solve second order differential equations using matrix algebra or linear equations.
