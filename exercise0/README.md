exercise 0 contained 3 questions.

the first was to measure the area of a circle where the radius of the circle is 
* given as user input 
* hard coded into the code 
* iterated over a range of values to compute respective areas
** which are then printed on the terminal
** saved to a file

the second exercise was to measure the machine precision of the system, for variables defined as single i.e float and double

the third was to convert an integer in base 10 to it's binary equivalent.

the files area.*, precision.* and base_conversion.* are my solutions to the aforementioned problems.
area.f is still underconstruction and is still in the works.

-----

the big take away from this exercise is how to estimate machine precision, how to convert a number to it's binary equivalent and
how to take user inout in c, fortran and python
how to read from and write to files in said languages
