int main(void){ ... return 0;}
void main{}
double func(double input1, double input2){ ... return result}
int, float, double
double *var_pointer
var_pointer = &var
printf("the value of var is %d", *var_pointer)
* is to point to the value at the address location and
& is to know the address location of the variable
for (i=0;i<N;i++){}
scanf("%d",&a)
printf("var = %d",var)
puts("to print a string")
%f, %lf, %c, %s

need to add how to load data, from raw input during execution, from the command line and from files
also how to print output to files
pointers, array pointers and file pointers
dynamic memory allocation
linking random libraries, like math.h, while compilation
